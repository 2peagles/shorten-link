# shorten-link
Frontend Mentor Challenge

SO design wise I got stuck on my navbar I wanted to push the last two items to the right while keeping the first 3 items well four items left. I used the :nth-child() property which actually really comes in handy. I don't think I used it before but I will be for now on.

I was actually proud of this line of code as well, the invalid part was nice I haven't worked with input fields so it was nice.
`
input[type=url]:focus:invalid{
    color: red;
    outline: .2rem solid red;
}
